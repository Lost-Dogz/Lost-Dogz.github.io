# Bitcoin Icons (WIP)

Bitcoin Icons is an open-source/open-design set of icons made for Bitcoin centric applications. Included are general icons most applications need like arrows and a home icon, and maybe more importantly Bitcoin-specific icons like a wallet, keys, miner and Bitcoin symbols.

Icons are available as a [public Figma community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/948545404023677970/Bitcoin-icon-set) for design work. This repository contains icon exports as SVGs for implementation.

For requests, please leave a comment on the Figma file or post an issue to this repo. This could be new icons, improvements to existing icons, more style or export formats, or anything else. Just reach out.

Bitcoin Icons is a sister project of the [Bitcoin Wallet UI Kit](https://www.figma.com/file/VB3GQdAnhl8yta44DY3PSV/Bitcoin-Wallet-UI-Kit) created by [GBKS](https://github.com/GBKS).

## Node Module

The node module is still in development. For now, you can install it and then pull
the SVGs into a build system such as Gulp. In the future, there may be more options
for importing the icons, such as font files, javascript imports, etc.

To install the node module pre-release version, run:

```
npm install @bitcoin-design/bitcoin-icons
```
